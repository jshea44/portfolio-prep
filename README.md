3. pitch - Hi, my name is Joshua Shea.

I’m a former Air Force Security Forces member with a strong passion for software development and an acute attention to detail. I've decided to pursue software development because of the endless possibilities as well as the ability to create something that potentially thousands, if not millions, of people will use. Throughout my experience in the military, I’ve gained self-discipline, as well as the ability to thrive under pressure which have allowed me to ensure the safety and security of personnel and critical assets, which I am confident will translate seamlessly into the world of tech. In addition to my military experience, I have devoted time and effort to self teaching myself programming skills, immersing myself in various languages and frameworks and excel in writing clean and efficient code. I am driven to make a positive impact in the industry and am eager to contribute to innovative projects at your organization.

Thank you for considering my application.

4. what excites me the most - the possibilities to create something. To compliment the lifestyles of people not complicate.
